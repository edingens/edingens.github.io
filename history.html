    <!-- Historical Practices -->
    <section class="container py-4">
        <h2>Local Eating Through the Ages</h2>
        <p>
            Before industrialization, communities relied heavily on local markets and seasonal diets. Food was grown, harvested, 
            and consumed in harmony with the seasons, promoting fresher, healthier diets and reducing waste. This system also 
            fostered close connections between farmers and consumers, creating resilient, self-sustaining local economies.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, during the pre-industrial era in Europe and the United States, local farms and markets were the lifelines 
            of food supply. Families often preserved seasonal foods through techniques like drying, fermenting, or canning, ensuring 
            that nothing went to waste. These practices, while simple, were remarkably sustainable and minimized the need for long-distance 
            transportation.
        </p>

    <!-- Industrialization -->
    <section class="container py-4 bg-light">
        <h2>Industrialization and the Global Food System</h2>
        <p>
            The advent of industrialization in the 19th and 20th centuries brought profound changes to the way we grow, transport, and consume food. 
            Innovations like refrigeration, global shipping networks, and advancements in preservation made it possible to transport food 
            across vast distances. While this brought greater convenience and variety, it also disconnected consumers from their food sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the mid-20th century, foods like avocados and bananas—once regional delicacies—became global commodities. For example, 
            eating avocado in Alaska became possible, but at a significant environmental cost. These shifts moved us further away 
            from seasonal eating and towards year-round availability, regardless of ecological or economic consequences.

    <!-- Case Study: Victory Gardens -->
    <section class="container py-4">
        <h2>Case Study: Victory Gardens During WWII</h2>
        <p>
            During World War II, Victory Gardens became a symbol of resilience and sustainability. In response to food shortages, 
            millions of households across the U.S. and Europe grew their own fruits, vegetables, and herbs. By 1943, these gardens 
            produced nearly 40% of the fresh produce consumed in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            Victory Gardens remind us of the power of localized food systems. They demonstrated that communities could adapt to crises 
            by cultivating self-sufficiency and reducing reliance on industrial supply chains. Today, urban farming and backyard gardens 
            can play a similar role in promoting sustainability.

    <!-- Lessons From History -->
    <section class="container py-4 bg-light">
        <h2>What Can We Learn From History?</h2>
        <p>
            History teaches us that sustainable eating is not a new concept—it’s how humanity thrived for centuries. By returning to 
            practices like seasonal eating, preserving local produce, and supporting local farmers, we can create food systems 
            that are better for both people and the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The simplicity of eating what’s available locally and seasonally can significantly reduce the environmental footprint of our meals. 
            Embracing the rhythms of nature, as our ancestors did, is a practical step toward sustainability.
