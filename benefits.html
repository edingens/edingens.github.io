    <!-- Main Content -->
    <section class="container py-4">
        <h2>1. Environmental Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            Eating locally grown food reduces carbon emissions by minimizing the need for long-distance transportation. 
            According to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the typical American meal contains ingredients from 
            five different countries, requiring extensive shipping, refrigeration, and packaging. By choosing local and seasonal 
            foods, we cut down on these environmental costs and help preserve biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Local food systems also encourage sustainable farming practices that protect soil health, water quality, and ecosystems. 
            Supporting small-scale farms helps maintain a diverse landscape and reduces the environmental degradation caused by industrial 
            monoculture farming.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Economic Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            Buying local strengthens the local economy by keeping money within the community. When you purchase directly from farmers at 
            farmers' markets or through Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs, you’re not only supporting local jobs but also 
            fostering relationships with the people who grow your food.
        </p>
        <p>
            Studies show that small farms are more likely to reinvest in their communities compared to large industrial farms. This creates 
            a ripple effect, boosting nearby businesses, promoting economic resilience, and preserving rural areas from being paved over for 
            industrial or commercial development.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Health Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            Local foods are fresher and more nutrient-rich than their long-distance counterparts. Fruits and vegetables that are shipped 
            thousands of miles are often harvested before they are fully ripe, which reduces their flavor and nutritional value. By eating 
            produce that is grown locally, you enjoy food that is at its peak in both taste and health benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Local foods also tend to have fewer preservatives and chemical treatments, as they don’t need to withstand long transit or storage 
            periods. This makes them a safer and healthier choice for you and your family.

        <h2>How You Can Start Eating Local</h2>
        <p>
            The good news is that we can take steps to address these issues. By choosing locally grown and seasonal foods, we can reduce carbon 
            emissions, support small farmers, and reconnect with our food sources. Every choice we make matters—start small by exploring local 
            farmers' markets, joining a CSA program, or simply considering the journey your food has taken to reach your plate.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visit farmers' markets in your area to find fresh, locally grown produce.</li>
            <li>Join a CSA program to receive a regular supply of seasonal fruits and vegetables directly from a local farm.</li>
            <li>Support restaurants and businesses that prioritize sourcing their ingredients locally.</li>
            <li>Grow your own fruits, vegetables, or herbs, even if it’s just a small windowsill garden.</li>
