    <!-- Main Content -->
    <section class="container py-4">
        <!-- Carbon Footprint -->
        <h2>1. The Carbon Footprint of Food</h2>
        <p>
            The average meal in America travels an astonishing 1,500 miles to reach your plate. This journey involves multiple modes of transportation, including trucks, ships, and airplanes—all of which contribute to significant carbon emissions. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the emissions generated from transporting food across continents far exceed those of locally sourced alternatives. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, out-of-season strawberries imported from another country not only require refrigeration during transit but also produce a much larger carbon footprint than locally grown, in-season fruits. Similarly, broccoli shipped thousands of miles contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>

        <!-- Resource Use -->
        <h2>2. Unsustainable Resource Use</h2>
        <p>
            Mass agriculture for export is often linked to deforestation, overuse of water resources, and habitat destruction. In regions that focus heavily on monoculture crops for export, biodiversity suffers, and soil fertility declines over time. This unsustainable model not only depletes natural resources but also destabilizes local ecosystems, leaving long-term environmental scars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Water-intensive crops, such as almonds and avocados, grown in areas with limited water resources for global export further exacerbate these challenges. While the demand for such products grows, the local environment pays the price.
        </p>

        <!-- Economic Impact -->
        <h2>3. The Decline of Small Farmers</h2>
        <p>
            The global supply chain often marginalizes small-scale farmers, as large corporations dominate the food market. These multinational companies prioritize profit over sustainability, creating an uneven playing field that pushes local farmers out of business.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to studies, the reliance on imported foods diminishes food sovereignty—the ability of communities to control their food systems. This not only affects the livelihoods of small farmers but also reduces the availability of fresh, local produce in our communities.
        </p>

        <!-- Social Impact -->
        <h2>4. Disconnection from Food Sources</h2>
        <p>
            The industrialization of food has created a disconnection between consumers and their food sources. Many people are unaware of where their food comes from, how it was grown, or the environmental and social costs involved. This disconnect fosters a lack of accountability and perpetuates harmful food systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            By prioritizing convenience and variety over sustainability, we lose the opportunity to build trust with local farmers and make informed food choices. This lack of connection also affects our ability to embrace seasonal eating—a practice that aligns with nature's cycles and reduces environmental impact.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Call to Action -->
    <section class="container py-4 bg-light text-center">
        <h3>What Can We Do?</h3>
        <p>
            The good news is that we can take steps to address these issues. By choosing locally grown and seasonal foods, we can reduce carbon emissions, support small farmers, and reconnect with our food sources. Every choice we make matters—start small by exploring local farmers' markets, joining a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program, or simply considering the journey your food has taken to reach your plate.
