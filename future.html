    <!-- Urban Farming Section -->
    <section class="container py-4">
        <h2>1. Urban Farming: Bringing Agriculture to the City</h2>
        <p>
            Urban farming is a growing movement that utilizes spaces like rooftops, abandoned lots, and community gardens to produce fresh, 
            local food in urban areas. Innovations such as vertical farming and hydroponics make it possible to grow produce with minimal land 
            and water usage, directly addressing the challenges of urbanization and food deserts.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, cities like New York and Singapore have embraced rooftop farming initiatives, creating green spaces that reduce urban heat 
            islands while providing fresh food. Urban farming not only improves access to healthy produce but also fosters stronger connections 
            between city residents and their food sources.

    <!-- Regenerative Agriculture Section -->
    <section class="container py-4 bg-light">
        <h2>2. Regenerative Agriculture: Healing the Land</h2>
        <p>
            Inspired by historical farming practices, regenerative agriculture focuses on improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and 
            capturing carbon to mitigate climate change. Techniques such as cover cropping, crop rotation, and reduced tillage restore 
            ecosystems and make agriculture more sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regenerative farms, like those led by the Rodale Institute, demonstrate how these methods can increase yields, reduce water 
            usage, and rebuild soil. By adopting these practices, we can create a food system that is both productive and environmentally 
            restorative.

    <!-- Zero-Waste Food Systems Section -->
    <section class="container py-4">
        <h2>3. Zero-Waste Food Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Zero-waste food systems aim to minimize waste by repurposing by-products and reducing inefficiencies in the supply chain. This 
            concept aligns with historical practices where every part of a plant or animal was utilized. Today, startups are embracing 
            circular food economies that turn food waste into valuable resources, such as compost, bioenergy, or even new food products.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, companies like Too Good To Go help prevent food waste by connecting consumers with surplus food from restaurants and 
            grocery stores. These innovations reduce waste, save money, and lower the environmental impact of our food systems.

    <!-- Lessons from the Past Section -->
    <section class="container py-4 bg-light">
        <h2>4. Learning from the Past: A Path to a Sustainable Future</h2>
        <p>
            History shows us that sustainable practices, such as seasonal eating, food preservation, and local sourcing, can thrive in modern 
            contexts. Victory Gardens during WWII proved that individuals and communities could play a vital role in building resilient food 
            systems. By reintroducing these practices, we can reconnect with our food and reduce dependence on industrial agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Embracing simplicity—such as eating what’s in season and growing food in our backyards or urban spaces—can have profound impacts. 
            These timeless approaches remind us that sustainability is not just about innovation but also about returning to practices that 
            respect natural cycles.
        </p>

    <!-- Call to Action -->
    <section class="container py-4 text-center">
        <h3>What Can You Do?</h3>
        <p>
            The future of food lies in our hands. By supporting urban farms, choosing regenerative products, reducing food waste, and adopting 
            seasonal eating habits, we can create a sustainable and equitable food system for generations to come.
